# Analyzing test failures

Test failures are recorded as failed executions in Buildkite Test Engine.

When asked to analyze test failures you MUST follow these rules:
- You SHOULD check for failed test executions in test engine runs before reading job logs
- You SHOULD perform a root-cause analysis for each failure
